GET    /api/documents/patient/:patientId  - Get patient documents
GET    /api/documents/download/:id        - Download document
POST   /api/documents/:id/qr-code         - Generate QR code
POST   /api/documents/:id/share           - Share document
DELETE /api/documents/:id                 - Delete document
GET    /api/documents/stats               - Get document statistics
```

### Public Routes (No Authentication Required)
```
GET    /api/documents/public/access/:token    - Access document via QR code
GET    /api/documents/public/download/:token  - Download document via QR code
```

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
npm install multer crypto qrcode uuid express-rate-limit
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_PWD=your_mongodb_password

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Document Encryption Key (32 characters for AES-256)
DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key-32-chars-long

# Frontend URL for QR Code Generation
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```

### Frontend Dependencies
The required packages are already included in the project:
- React Icons for UI icons
- React Toastify for notifications
- Axios for API calls

## Usage Guide

### 1. Uploading Documents
1. Navigate to the Documents page
2. Select a patient (for doctors) or use your own record (for patients)
3. Click "Upload New" tab
4. Drag and drop or select a file
5. Fill in document details (type, description, tags, access level)
6. Click "Upload Document"

### 2. Managing Documents
1. View all documents in the Documents tab
2. Use action buttons for each document:
   - **Download**: Save document to local device
   - **QR Code**: Generate shareable QR code
   - **Share**: Share with specific users
   - **Delete**: Remove document (owners only)

### 3. Sharing via QR Code
1. Click the QR Code button on any document
2. Set expiration time (default: 24 hours)
3. Share the generated QR code or access link
4. Recipients can scan QR code or use link to access document

### 4. Access Control
- **Private**: Only document owner can access
- **Doctor Only**: All doctors can access
- **Shared**: Specific users with time limits

## Security Features

### Encryption
- Documents are encrypted using AES-256-CBC
- Each document has a unique initialization vector (IV)
- Encryption key is stored in environment variables

### Access Control
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Role-based permissions (patient/doctor)
- Time-limited sharing with QR codes
- User-specific access grants

### File Validation
- File type restrictions
- Size limits (10MB maximum)
- MIME type validation
- Secure file handling

## File Format Support

### Supported Document Types
- **PDF**: Medical reports, forms
- **Word Documents**: Letters, notes
- **Excel Files**: Data sheets, reports
- **Text Files**: Simple notes, logs

- **Secure Tokens**: Random 32-character access tokens
- **Public Access**: No authentication required for QR access
- **Automatic Expiration**: Access expires automatically

### Usage
1. Generate QR code for document
2. Share QR code image or access link
3. Recipients scan or click link
4. Access document before expiration
5. Automatic cleanup after expiration

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
